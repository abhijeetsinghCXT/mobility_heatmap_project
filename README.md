**1. Project Overview**
   
This repository houses a project focused on using Artificial Intelligence and geospatial data analysis to optimize urban infrastructure. By analyzing large-scale mobility data, we generate mobility heatmaps to identify high-traffic zones, apply K-Means Clustering to pinpoint specific congestion hotspots, and develop a custom Pathway Efficiency Scoring Model to propose targeted, data-driven solutions for urban planners. The goal is to enhance traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve urban accessibility.

**2. Objectives**
   
‚úÖ Collect and Analyze mobility data to identify high-traffic zones.

üó∫Ô∏è Generate interactive mobility heatmaps (Folium) for visual density representation.

ü§ñ Utilize K-Means clustering to precisely locate critical congestion hotspots.

üìä Develop a Pathway Efficiency Score to quantify flow performance.

üí° Propose smart pathway re-designs and infrastructure improvements based on data analysis.

**3. Prerequisites**
To run this project, you need Python installed, along with the following libraries:

Bash

`pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn folium scikit-learn`

**4. Files in this Repository**
   
smart_mobility_dataset.csv	  -  Input Data: The simulated dataset containing Lat/Lon, Vehicle Count, Speed, and Traffic Condition.
smart_pathway_notebook.ipynb  -  Main Code: A Jupyter/Colab notebook containing all the project steps, from data loading and EDA to heatmap generation, clustering, efficiency scoring, and final proposal.
README.md - This documentation file.


**5. Methodology and Execution**
The project execution is encapsulated within the smart_pathway_notebook.ipynb file and proceeds in these sequential steps:

Step 5.1: Data Loading & EDA
The initial phase loads the smart_mobility_dataset.csv file into a Pandas DataFrame (df) and performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to check data types, statistics, and traffic condition distribution.

Step 5.2: Mobility Heatmap Visualization
An interactive map is created using Folium and the HeatMap plugin. The density of the heatmap is weighted by the Vehicle_Count column, visually highlighting the areas of highest traffic concentration.

Step 5.3: Congestion Hotspot Identification
The K-Means Clustering algorithm is applied specifically to data points marked with 'High' traffic condition.
The resulting cluster centroids define the 5 critical geographic hotspots (k=5) that require infrastructure assessment. The cluster centers are stored in the hotspots variable.

Step 5.4: Pathway Efficiency Scoring Model
A simple, AI-derived Efficiency Score is calculated for every data point to quantify pathway performance. This score is used to assess the severity of congestion at each hotspot:

**Efficiency¬†Score=(Traffic¬†Condition¬†Value)√ó(Normalized¬†Traffic¬†Speed)**
Where a higher score indicates better flow.

Step 5.5: Smart Pathway Proposal
For each of the 5 identified hotspots, the average Efficiency Score in its immediate vicinity is calculated. A specific proposal is then generated.
